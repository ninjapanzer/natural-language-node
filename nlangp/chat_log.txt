1 (22:53:38) kriston: What is username/password for Fedora 18 LXDE spin?  I found it nowhere.
2 (22:55:06) kriston: (live CD naturally)
3 (22:55:41) jamielennox left the room (quit: Remote host closed the connection).
4 (22:56:05) satellit_e: live user  no password I think
5 (22:58:48) sayan [~sayanchow@fedora/sayan] entered the room.
6 (22:59:21) kriston: I can log into text console fine.  The lxdm greeter wants a user and password.  There isn't anyone called "live" or "user" anywhere in /etc/passwd.  Just root but it won't let root in even if I give root a real password.  WTF?
7 (22:59:57) the_mgt left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 264 seconds).
8 (23:00:18) majorlinux: kriston, I think he meant "liveuser"
9 (23:00:31) kriston: I know, "liveuser" is not in /etc/passwd either.
10  (23:00:55) kriston: Thanks for the tip though.
11  (23:01:01) majorlinux: Couldn't you just create the user, then?
12  (23:01:10) majorlinux: Nevermind...
13  (23:01:18) sayan left the room (quit: Max SendQ exceeded).
14  (23:01:20) kriston: What USB installer do we use for Fedora spins?  I've ben using pendrivelinux but it might be corrupting things.
15  (23:01:34) kriston: majorlinux: Thanks, I understand.
16  (23:01:38) majorlinux: I use livecd-tools (actually using it now)
17  (23:02:08) majorlinux: livecd-iso-to-disk
18  (23:02:09) kriston: If I'm on a Windows host, what would I use?  I think pendrivelinux is corrupting things too much.  I'm having too many problems with usb installers.
19  (23:02:43) kriston: Like, a half-dozen LXDE spins, remixes, and releases do not act like the online docs suggest I should expect.
20  (23:02:51) majorlinux: https://fedorahosted.org/liveusb-creator/
21  (23:03:09) kriston: Thank you I will give that a go.  I was about to doubt my own sanity.
22  (23:03:16) sayan [~sayanchow@fedora/sayan] entered the room.
23  (23:03:27) kriston: Well I always doubted my own sanity.
24  (23:03:41) majorlinux: That's to be expected when using Linux sometimes...hehe
25  (23:03:53) jcape left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 252 seconds).
26  (23:04:14) kriston: I mean when at least three Linuxes say to log in as a certain user, and that user is clearly not in /etc/passwd, it makes me lose my mind.
27  (23:04:17) kriston: Thanks!!!
28  (23:04:26) Forty-3 left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 248 seconds).
29  (23:04:46) mayorgalinux left the room (quit: Remote host closed the connection).
30  (23:07:16) sayan left the room (quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer).
31  (23:07:31) waz0wski left the room (quit: Quit: waz0wski).
32  (23:07:33) waz0wski_ is now known as waz0wski
33  (23:09:15) nathan28: i wonder what those 'three Linuxes' are
34  (23:10:26) kriston: nathan28: Clever.  Distributions, naturally.  Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian.
35  (23:10:54) nathan28: it's been a long time since i used a liveCD anything
36  (23:11:02) niteshnarayanlal [~nitesh@fedora/niteshnarayanlal] entered the room.
37  (23:11:05) kriston: Of course it has.
38  (23:12:22) kriston: Yep, Pendrivelinux corrupted the living crap out of the image.  It works now.  Thanks, majorlinux
39  (23:12:44) nathan28: cleanly unmount next time
40  (23:12:45) majorlinux: kriston, Glad I was able to help.
41  (23:12:51) kriston: nathan28: No, naturally, that's wrong.
42  (23:15:10) nathan28: or just use dd on a bootable image?
43  (23:15:15) kriston: Ubuntu and friends point users to Pendrivelinux for usb disk installers.  Unfortunately, it does extra modifications when it creates the image.  Ubuntu isn't affected but others are.
44  (23:15:37) kriston: Windows, nathan28.  I'm not inclined to bother with rawrite or dd here unless you have a known-good solution for that?
45  (23:15:38) fenrus02: use dd.
46  (23:15:44) kriston: I did say Windows.
47  (23:15:46) nathan28: dd
48  (23:15:48) nathan28: dd.exe
49  (23:15:48) fenrus02: and?
50  (23:15:50) fenrus02: winblows has dd.
51  (23:16:05) fenrus02: use the live images found in the /topic here.
52  (23:16:08) kriston: Known-good URL for downloading dd.exe or GTFO.
53  (23:16:11) fenrus02: they have updates applied, and will save you time.
54  (23:16:15) nathan28: kriston: google
55  (23:16:23) nathan28: and a compiler
56  (23:16:25) fenrus02: kriston, language. this is a family channel.
57  (23:16:27) kriston: nathan28: No.  Known-good URL is not "google"
58  (23:16:39) nathan28: gcc is pretty good i hear
59  (23:16:44) StillBob: lazy is demanding
60  (23:17:02) kriston: And all of our 132 Windowss machine doesn't have a compiler.  Did you want to help or did you not?
61  (23:17:15) fenrus02: kriston, calm down, or take a break.
62  (23:17:34) kriston: Every IRC conversation turns out the same way.  Why are you even here?
